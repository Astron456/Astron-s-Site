abstract: "This study note provides a review of some previous researches on Vector Autoregressions (VARs) and Local Projections (LPs). It gives detail review of the equivalence of these two methods when the data generating process (DGP) follows the VAR process by Jorda (2005), and their approximate equivalence in the scheme under Mollor and Wolf (2021) when the DGP is unknown. Furthermore, this note shows a same empirical example using different data set to re-illustrate some of the key comparisons in their article."
