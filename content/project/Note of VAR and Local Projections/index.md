abstract: 'This note provides an overview of previous researches on Vector Autoregressions
(VARs) and Local Projections (LPs). I will detail the equivalence of these two methods
when the data generating process (DGP) follows the VAR process, and their approximate equivalence in the scheme under Plagborg-MÃ¸ller and Wolf (2021) when the
DGP is unknown. In addition, I use several extensive empirical examples in Macroeconomics to visualize some of the key comparisons in this article.'
