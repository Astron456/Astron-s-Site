Hi, I'm an undergraduate student of Finance from Nankai Univeristy. My interest lies in Macroecomomics, Econometrics and Time Series. Here I worked intensively with assistant professor Tian Xia about the impact of the information effect in monetary policy on various Macroeconomy sectors under different states of economic uncertainty.

For my personal research, I mainly focus on fields of VAR and local projections. Now, I'm working as a part-time research assistant in Peking University, Institute of New Structural Economics.
