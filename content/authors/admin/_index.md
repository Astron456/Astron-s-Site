Hi, I'm an undergraduate student of Finance from Nankai Univeristy. My interest lies in Game Theory, Econometrics and Robotics Engineering. Here I worked intensively with my mentor about the impact of the monetary policy's information effect on various Macroeconomy sectors under different states of economic uncertainty.

For my personal research, my other interest includes Development Economics. Now, I'm working as a research fellow intern at Peking University, Institute of New Structural Economics.
