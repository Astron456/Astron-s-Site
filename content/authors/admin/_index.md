Hi, I'm an undergraduate student of Finance from Nankai Univeristy. Here I work intensively with my mentor, professor Xin Geng, on fields of Nonparametric Estimation and Econometrics. I also work with my excellent alumini Peilin Yang from Standford University on topics of Local Projection and VAR.

For my internship experience, I worked as a policy analyst in China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC). I also worked as a data analyst with derivative department from Xiangcai Security on topics of debt issue and option pricing.
