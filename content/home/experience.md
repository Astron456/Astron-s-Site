        - We try to study the impact of the information effect of monetary policy on various sectors of the Macro economy under different states of economic uncertainty. 
        - Used the co-movement of high frequency federal fund future changes and S&P 500 indexes as symbol recognition to identify.
        - Use prior distribution proposed by Litterman (1986), combined with Gibbs sampling, to get the posterior distribution of the model.
        - Use the idea of TVAR to divide economic uncertainties into two stages and run regressions distinctively.

        - Compared the equivalence between VAR and Local Projection when the true model is VAR (Jorda 2005), and the equivalence relationship (when h<p) between VAR and linear Local Projection when the true model is unknown. (Mollor and Wolf, 2020)
        - Found that eventhough Mollor and Wolf's paper did not put restrictions to the real model, it was based on a strict assumption -- the Cholesky decomposition.
        - Wrote a detail note of this field. I used the high frequency data provided by Jarocinski and Karada to construct an empirical test.
